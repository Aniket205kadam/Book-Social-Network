# Book Social Network App

This repository contains the Book Social Network App, a project inspired by the tutorial series created by Bouali Ali. While the original tutorial used Spring Boot for the backend and Angular for the frontend, I focused on building the backend using Spring Boot, and I created the frontend from scratch using React.

## Overview

The Book Social Network App allows users to:

- Discover books.

- Add books to their wishlists.

- Interact with features typical of a social network centered around books.

## What I Learned

1. Understanding Business Requirements:

- Gained insights into how to approach a project by analyzing and implementing business requirements step by step.

2. Building a Full-Stack Application:

- This was my first experience creating a full-stack application, which gave me a solid understanding of integrating a backend with a frontend.

3. Backend Development with Spring Boot:

- Learned how to design and implement RESTful APIs.

- Worked with JPA/Hibernate for database interactions.

- Followed best practices for writing clean and efficient code in the backend.

4. Frontend Development with React:

- Developed the user interface from scratch using React instead of Angular.

- Learned to manage state effectively and handle user interactions.

- Used React Router for navigation.

- Added custom features to enhance user experience.

5. Adding Custom Features:

- Added additional features not covered in the tutorial to extend the application's functionality.

## Features

- Wishlist Management: Users can add or remove books from their wishlists.

- Social Interactions: Core social networking features centered around books.
